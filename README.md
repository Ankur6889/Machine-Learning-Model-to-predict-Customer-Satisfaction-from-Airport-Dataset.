# Machine-Learning-Model-to-predict-Customer-Satisfaction-from-Airport-Dataset.
The aim of this Project is to develop a machine learning model to predict/estimate customer satisfaction based on airport features using two different Machine Learning Algorithms. A dataset has been given consisting of 3502 data points and 37 features. The first step taken in this regard was Domain Analysis. It helped us in understanding the dataset , identifying its important features which helps us in further taking important decisions regarding model selection, feature engineering, data cleaning, etc. The next step was to clean the data and perform feature engineering to make the data ready for further processing. The cleaned and processed dataset was then subjected to PCA ( principal component analysis ) to reduce its dimensions. Then after careful consideration of various factors Linear regression and Random Forest was selected to build machine learning models from the processed data. Once models were implemented cross-validation techniques were implemented on the models to access their performance. Learning curves were plotted for both Models to evaluate their behavior towards unseen data. These two models were then also compared with kNN, AdaBoost, and Decision Tree. The results were then analyzed to identify the best algorithm for a given situation.
